1. I added 23 knots to the project  to meet the passage requirement. 
2. I added a flashlight, a shotgun, and clothes as pickups to unlock certain choices; with one choice needing two of these to be true. I used both Variables and the built in boolien for this
3. I gave the player a health condition in which they need to find steroids to bring them up to a health level that allows them to make a choice.
4. I also made sure to limit what text shows based on what passages have been visited
5. I also simulated time passing by only allowing one passage to be taken after visiting other portions of the building.
